      <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
      <p>I am a senior at the University of Texas at Arlington. I am a creative and artistic person who loves technology that is why I chose Communication Technology as my major since it deals with both. My ideal work enviorment is any office or home that is technology related that allows for an sense of creativity. I also have alot of customer service experience so I'm able to communicate and work with clients . I'd like to be developing/designing websites with clients directly or be upholding and updating current websites. As well as working with networks, servers, and cybersecurity.</p>

      <h3>Future Goals</h3>
      <p>After I graduate hopefully i'll be able to find a job relating to UX/UI Designing, IT or Front-End Developing. I would like to work for a IT company that provides logistics and solutions, a web based company or freelance web designing. As well as any SEO, Mobile Interface, or Business/Systems Analyst position. I would also want to be better within Adobe, creating my own graphics, videos, edits and more.</p>

    <div class="hire">
      <h3>Why should you hire me?</h3>
      <p>Companies should hire me because I will meet many requirements for my desired position. I am proficient in Adobe and Microsoft office and know multiple coding languages such as HTML,CSS, PHP and Javascript. Also being such a hard worker, and desire to succeed I will help the companies meet their requirements. I have a strong work ethic, strong analytical reasoning aptitude, problem-solving, and ability to effectively operate both independently and as part of a team with strong communication and interpersonal skills. Flexibility to quickly adjust to unforeseen changes in priorities and workload while remaining extremely organized and following tight deadlines</p>
